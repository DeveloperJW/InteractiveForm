# InteractiveForm

- Purpose of this project: 

  This project is created for the purpose of JavaScript Full Stack TechDegree - Unit 03 with TeamTreehouse. 
  
- Project Description:
  - Use JavaScript and jQuery to enhance an interactive registration form. 
  
  - Used Regular Expression to check the format of form input
  

Extra Credit:
-

- #1: T Shirt Section

  Hide the "Color" label and select menu until a T-Shirt design is selected from the "Design" menu.

- #2: Conditional Error Message

  Program at least one of the error messages so that more information is provided depending on the error. 
  
  For validation of credit card information, I use conditional error message on Credit Card Number, 
  Zip Code and CVV. Different error message will be displayed based on the situations of errors.

   Also, I used regular expression to check the format of input. For example, name fields can only
   contain letters; credit card number, zip code and CVV can only contain numbers.

- #3: Real-time Error Messages

    I apply real-time error message on Name and Email fields
    
    so that it provides a real-time validation error message for at least one text input field. 
    Rather than providing an error message on submit, your form should check for errors and display messages as the 
    user begins typing inside a text field.
